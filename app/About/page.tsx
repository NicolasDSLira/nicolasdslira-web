                <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Nicolas Lira, fullstack developer with a love for creating web solutions that combine innovation and efficiency. With a solid academic background in System Analysis and Development, my experience in Project development allows me to transform ideas into robust and personalized digital products.</p>
                <p>Working as a freelancer, I developed the website for the Nossa Senhora Aparecida Promotional Service institution (servproaparecida.org.br) using the Laravel framework, TailwindCSS for responsive design, and MySQL for data management. As a developer at Raiztec, I was responsible for updating the company's institutional website, as well as maintaining and correcting BUG's, in addition to developing Landing pages for advertising with Google ADS to attract new customers.</p>
                <p>Still at Raiztec, I was responsible for the complete development of the institutional website of the company Coco Premium (cocopremium.com.br), where I used Laravel, TailwindCSS, and MySQL. This project also included the creation of a REST API for secondary functionalities and the use of Git for code versioning, in addition to developing the online store layout with Twig.</p>
                <p>My professional approach is focused on offering solutions that meet each client's specific needs, always keeping a close eye on user experience and code quality. I am constantly looking for new learning and growth opportunities, actively participating in technology events and expanding my knowledge in the development area. With a professional and collaborative attitude, I am ready to take on new challenges and contribute to projects that require technical excellence and creativity.</p>
